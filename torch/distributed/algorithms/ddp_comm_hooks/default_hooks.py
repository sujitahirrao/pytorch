    This DDP communication hook just calls ``allreduce`` using ``GradBucket``

    DDP results is expected to be same as the case where no hook was registered.
    Hence, this won't change behavior of DDP and user can use this as a reference
    or modify this hook to log useful information or any other purposes while
    unaffecting DDP behavior.
